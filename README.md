- 👋 Hi, I’m @luiz-flavio-rodrigues
- 👀 I’m interested in weather forecast models and all things related to this.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning julia language and new global models
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all development related with future of man kind, specially concerned about climate changes and natural disaster.
- 📫 You can reach me at mail luizfrodrigues@protonmail.com

I have a degree in physics from UNESP (Paulista State University - Brazil) and post-Graduated in Public Management from FGV (Getulio Vargas Foundation - master degree). I worked for 10 years with electronics in ground segment of satelittes data processing and control at the National Institute of Space Research (INPE) and 26 years in this same institution with numerical modeling of weather forecast, especially with the BRAMS' model. Part of that time I led the supercomputing and support services (supercomputers) of the Center for Weather Forecasting and Climate Studies (CPTEC). I worked with NEC vector machines, Parallel massive machines like Cray, Dell and others. I have knowledge in high performance processing, Fortran and some knowledge in Python. I have currently dedicated myself to learning the Julia language.
